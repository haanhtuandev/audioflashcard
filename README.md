One day I was travelling home by Grab bike from my university, I realized the time i spent sitting one the back of the motorbike could be utilized to do something productive. 
But the thing is, there is not much things you can do with a huge suitcase on your lap whilst sitting on a 40-50 km per hour motorbike.
The only thing that was accessible was my earphones.
By using the buttons on my earphones i could change song, adjust the volume, and stop/play music. I asked myself, what if, just what if, I could make a flashcard app that allows user to control the learning process by simply clicking buttons.
So, I made this little software.
